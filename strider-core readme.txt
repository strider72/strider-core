Strider Core Readme

Note:  Strider Core is still in development.

Strider Core is a framework for use in other plugins.  It is not a plugin unto itself.  It includes many points of minor functionality and polish, such as Settings page links from the Plugins page, and an attribution in the footer of the Settings page.  A significant feature is the ability to activate integrated version checking for plugins not hosted on WP-Extend.

Strider Core also has an interesting feature in that if multiple plugins are built on it, they will all use whichever is the highest version present.  Thus, upgrading one plugin can improve all of the Strider Core plugins.
