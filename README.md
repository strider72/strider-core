# strider-core

Strider Core is a framework for use in WordPress plugins. It is not a plugin unto itself. A significant feature is the ability to activate integrated version checking for plugins not hosted on WP-Extend. It also includes many points of minor functionality and polish, such as Settings page links from the Plugins page, and an attribution in the footer of the Settings page.

Strider Core also has an interesting feature in that if multiple plugins are built on it, they will all use whichever is the highest version present. Thus, upgrading one plugin can improve the function of other Strider Core plugins running at the same time.
